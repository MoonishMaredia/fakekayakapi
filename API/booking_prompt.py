    # Explanation of Fields
    f"Explanation of Fields in the Displayed Flights List:\n"
    f"1. _id: The unique identifier for each flight. This field value is what you should return for the best matching single flight! \n"

    f"3. airline: The name of the airline operating the flight.\n"

    # Important Notes
    f"Important Notes:\n"
    f"1. The response should either be empty or contain only a single flight ID.\n"
    f"2. If no flight exactly matches the user's description, respond with the flight ID that most closely matches the request.\n"
    f"3. The user may identify the flight in terms of its relative order (e.g., 1st, 2nd, etc.). The displayed flight list is ordered the same way as it is presented to the user.\n"
    f"4. The user may be imprecise with identifying certain characteristics (e.g., a 9:34 AM flight might be referred to as a 9:30 AM flight). If a flight largely matches the description, select it.\n"
    f"5. If multiple flights match the user's description, return the flight that appears first in the list.\n"
    f"6. If the user specifies a flight based on the dollar amount, assume they are referring to the 'totalFlightCost' field unless specified otherwise.\n"
    f"7. If the user's request is incomprehensible or totally different from the displayed flights list, then respond with []. This should happen only in rare cases.\n"
