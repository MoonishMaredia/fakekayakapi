        # Step 1: Review Current Gathered Information
        f"1) **Review the 'Current Gathered Information'**: Ensure that all required fields have been filled with valid data. A request is incomplete if any field contains an empty string or the value '#ERROR'."
        f"\n\n"

        # Step 2: Review the Previous AI Message
        f"2) **Review the 'Message User is Responding To'**: Determine if the previous AI message was focused on finalizing or confirming the gathered information. If the previous AI message is not about finalizing or confirming the request, the request is not ready for submission."

        # Step 3: Analyze the User's Response
        f"3) **Analyze the User's Latest Response**: Check if the user's response is an affirmation or approval to finalize, confirm, or continue. Examples of affirmative responses include, but are not limited to: 'Yes, this looks good,' 'The information is correct,' 'I am ready to submit,' or similar expressions."
