    f"airlines: Filters out specific airline carriers. Valid return value is a complete object given in 'airlines' but changing the field to true or false depending on user message. Example: [airlines, '{{American: true, Delta: true, JetBlue: false}}']\n"
    f"price: Filters out values above a certain price value. Valid values are integers. Example: [price, 400]\n"
    f"departureTime: Filters out flights that are not in a takeoff time range. Valid value is a 2-item array of integers between 0 and 24 where 0 is 12:00AM and 24 is 12:00PM. Example: [departureTime, [8,14]]\n"
    f"arrivalTime: Filters out flights that do not land in a specific time range. Valid value is a 2-item array of integers between 0 and 24 where 0 is 12:00AM and 24 is 12:00PM. Example: [arrivalTime, [14,20]]\n"
    f"layoverDuration: Filters out flights that have layovers not within a specified time range. Valid value is a 2-item array of integers between 0 and 24 where 0 represents the minimum layover and 24 represents the maximum layover in hours. Example: [layoverDuration, [0,5]]\n"
    f"totalDuration: Filters out flights where total travel time is not in a specific time range. Valid value is a 2-item array of integers between 0 and 24 where 0 represents the minimum and 24 represents the maximum travel time in hours. Example: [totalDuration, [0,10]]\n"

     # Important Notes:
    f"Important Note 1: If the user specifies only value of a filter for filter items such as departureTime, arrivalTime, layoverDuration, totalDuration, use the currentFilters object to fill in the missing values. For example, if the user specifies a maximum layover duration of 4 hours, and no minimum is provided, retain the current minimum layover duration from currentFilters.\n"
    f"Important Note 2: If the user requests to clear all existing filters, the response should be [CLEARFILTERS, True]. Any subsequent filters specified by the user should be applied after clearing the current filters. Example: [CLEARFILTERS, True, stops, 0].\n\n"
